README instructions for running zoom
Version 1
---------------------------------------------------
Running instructions for version 1
---------------------------------------------------
1.  compile zoom by: make all
2.  install module by: sudo insmod zoom.ko
3.  get the character device number by: cat /proc/devices | grep tstdvr
4.  install a device file by:  sudo mknod node c <device #> 0
5.  give character device proper permissions by:  sudo chmod 666 node
6.  run a process by:  work   # Note:  check argument list for options
7.  download data by: ./monitor ><output file>
8.  uninstall module by:  sudo rmmod zoom
9.  The output data will be stored in the <output file>
-----------------------------------------------------
Capabilities include:
- ability to allow a process to register and unregister with the module
- monitor process during running to capture performance parameters with memory
- parameters are mapped to user-space memory for recording

Updates made to version 2
------------------------------------------------------
Requirement:  Add signal from kernel sent to processes to notify memory pressure condition
------------------------------------------------------
1.  Change reported values in memory map to PID, delta minor page faults, delta major page faults, rss
2.  Add signal when rss gets above threshold value
3.  Add a memory pressure structure that is updated every work queue event
4.  Add signal handling to the work code so that something is printed to screen upon signal receipt
------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------
Updates made to version 3
------------------------------------------------------
Requirement:  Need to improve the work program to allow for children to be spawned
------------------------------------------------------
1.  Modified work to allow children to be spawned based on an additional command line argument
2.  Fixed small bug in zoom that didn't allow multiple processes to register
3.  Modified print output for monitor for correct titles and tabbed out lines
4.  Fixed a bug with signal to make sure memory pressure is reset when all processes are unregistered
------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------
Updates made to version 4
------------------------------------------------------
Requirement:  Improve the signal handling from the zoom module
------------------------------------------------------
1.  Reorganized the memory pressure handling into three routines:  one for calculating pressure, one for determining state and one for sending signal.
There are four states currently:  low, medium, high and emergency (These definitions are arbitrary and can be changed in the code).
2.  The work code recognizes the pressure state using the errno variable of the siginfo variable.
3.  The zoom code was updated to place the pressure state into the siginfo errno.
------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------
Updates made to version 5
------------------------------------------------------
Requirement:  Program the work program to react to memory pressure
------------------------------------------------------
1.  Added a function within the work program to free memory at 10% increments (based on pressure state) until the memory pressure level is low.
2.  Added a global that stores current pressure state as received from kernel.
3.  Modified the signal handler to store the pressure state.
------------------------------------------------------
Results observed:
1.  Running two instances of work, when a memory pressure state was entered, both processes freed memory (reducing rss) until a low pressure state occurred.  
------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------
Updates made to version 6
------------------------------------------------------
Requirement:  Program the work program to be able to customize children
------------------------------------------------------
1.  Added the capability for the work program to parse a file in the CWD named children.properties
2.  Added the capability to print the input from file to screen for checking
3.  Placed initial delays and iterative delays in code so that each process doesn't access data at same speed
