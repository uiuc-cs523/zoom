2.  install module by: sudo insmod zoom.ko
3.  get the character device number by: cat /proc/devices | grep tstdvr
4.  install a device file by:  sudo mknod node c <device #> 0
5.  give character device proper permissions by:  sudo chmod 666 node
6.  run a process by:  work   # Note:  check argument list for options
7.  download data by: ./monitor ><output file>
8.  uninstall module by:  sudo rmmod zoom
9.  The output data will be stored in the <output file>

Requirement:  Add signal from kernel sent to processes to notify memory pressure condition
------------------------------------------------------
1.  Change reported values in memory map to PID, delta minor page faults, delta major page faults, rss
2.  Add signal when rss gets above threshold value
3.  Add a memory pressure structure that is updated every work queue event
4.  Add signal handling to the work code so that something is printed to screen upon signal receipt

Updates made to version 3
------------------------------------------------------
Requirement:  Need to improve the work program to allow for children to be spawned
------------------------------------------------------
1.  Modified work to allow children to be spawned based on an additional command line argument
2.  Fixed small bug in zoom that didn't allow multiple processes to register
3.  Modified print output for monitor for correct titles and tabbed out lines
4.  Fixed a bug with signal to make sure memory pressure is reset when all processes are unregistered
